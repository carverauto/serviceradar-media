<!-- 
What led us to this opportunity:

My journey into the tech world began in the early '90s, at the age of 13, diving headfirst into
the computer hacking and phreaking scene. I was one of the founders of the hacker collective known
as 'w00w00', where some of the members went on to create Napster, WhatsApp, CloudVolumes, and others. 
Kevin and I met through that group while in high school and have worked together on various projects
ever since.

Most recently, Kevin, Rutvik, and I worked together to build ChaseApp, an entertainment app that
released into both the Apple and Google app stores. I found Rutvik through social media and hired
him to help with the mobile development. Rutvik and I hit it off and have collaborated together 
over the past several years on various projects.

Kevin and I also most recently worked together at a threat intelligence company funded by In-Q-Tel. 
Kevin created and developed Fume.App, a platform for serverless deployment of web applications and 
cloud functions.

Shruti is the newest member to our team and has been a great addition. Shruti and I worked together on
the Mage.AI opensource data transformation orchestration project, contributing several new features. 
Prior to that, she was an SRE at Amazon worked on the platform engineering team at Twitter.

that can cut through the noise, making sense of the vast streams of digital communication. 

The AI Advantage:

Consider the impact of AI in our daily workflows. Slack AI's success, saving users an average of 97 minutes per 
week, isn't just a statistic; it's a testament to the hunger for efficiency and the potential of AI to meet this 
demand.

ThreadR's Role:

This is where ThreadR steps in. We're not just another tool; we're a solution designed to address these challenges 
head-on. By leveraging AI, ThreadR transforms the chaos of digital communication into clarity, enabling better 
decisions, faster actions, and ultimately, more time for what truly matters.

There's a significant opportunity for enterprise-level contracts and custom solutions. These not only bring 
in higher revenue but also deepen our relationships with key customers, turning them into long-term partners.

**Long-Term Vision**: Beyond initial capture, focusing on retention and expanding market share.

<!--

tiered approach not only makes our product accessible to a wide range of businesses but also aligns 
with our strategy to grow with our customers, maximizing lifetime value.
