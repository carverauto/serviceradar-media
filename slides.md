# The Growing Complexity of Digital Communications

In today's digital age, the landscape of communication is more varied and voluminous than ever before. With the proliferation of chat platforms like Slack, Discord, IRC, and Telegram, alongside traditional email exchanges, navigating and making sense of these vast data streams has become a formidable challenge. Organizations now face the daunting task of analyzing these communications effectively to foster collaboration, ensure compliance, and extract valuable insights. Moreover, the rapid evolution of language and communication patterns, accelerated by AI technologies, demands solutions that are not only comprehensive but also adaptable to the shifting dynamics of digital discourse.

# Navigating the Complexities of Modern Digital Communication

The exponential growth in digital communication platforms has led to an overwhelming increase in the volume and variety of data. Organizations struggle to keep pace with the information flow, leading to potential oversights in compliance, security, and valuable insights.

With the rapid expansion of remote work and digital collaboration, there has been a significant rise in miscommunication and misinformation. This not only affects productivity but also poses risks to organizational integrity and reputation.

As digital communication continues to evolve, traditional analysis tools fall short. The dynamic nature of online discourse, including the use of slang, emojis, and shorthand, requires advanced solutions capable of understanding and adapting to new communication styles.

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
}
</script>
```

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Motions

Motion animations are powered by [@vueuse/motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/), triggered by `v-motion` directive.

```html
<div

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Moanco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import hello from './external'

const code = ref('const a = 1')
hello()
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
function fibonacci(n: number): number {
  return n <= 1
    ? n
    : fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2) // you know, this is NOT the best way to do it :P
}

console.log(Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => fibonacci(i + 1)))
```
